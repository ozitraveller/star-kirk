# and add the gtkstep theme to the graphical Debian Installer.
# To enable it, copy or symlink this hook into your config/binary_local-hooks
# directory and add the replacement components at:

#  config/binary_debian-installer/

# The banner file should be a PNG image of dimensions 800 x 75.
# Any other components should be inside a compressed tar archive
# named additions.tar.gz with full file paths
