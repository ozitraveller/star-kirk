setnet
wpasupplicant
net-tools
iputils-ping
bind9-host
traceroute

Make sure wpasupplicant was running before starting setnet.sh

run these in separate terminals:
sudo ifup wlan0 &
sudo setnet.sh


Some suggestions for mount/unmount:
pmount
udevil
gvfs-backends gvfs-fuse
thunar-volman

Network connection and discovery
gigolo
avahi-utils


pcmanfm requires libfm-modules for mounting



Automounting of large external drives
If Thunar refuses to mount large removable media (size > 1TB) although thunar-volman and gvfs has been installed, 
then try installing a different automounter such as udevil or udiskie. The latter should be preferred as it uses 
udisks2 and thus is compatible with gvfs.

 
 
Trash
Some programs use ~/.local/share/Trash as a dumping ground, so don't forget to clean it out!
